# Bouncing Yellow Balls in a Rotating Sphere

This repository contains a Streamlit application that visualizes 15 bouncing yellow balls confined within a rotating 3D sphere using p5.js and WEBGL. The application features elastic collisions between the balls as well as between the balls and the spherical boundary.

## Features

- **3D Visualization:** Renders a dynamic 3D scene with WEBGL.
- **Bouncing Balls:** 15 yellow balls remain within a sphere sized at 93% of the canvas.
- **Collision Detection:** Elastic collision detection among balls and between balls and the container.
- **Rotating Scene:** The entire sphere rotates slowly to enhance the visual effect.
- **Responsive Design:** Automatically adjusts the canvas size when the window is resized.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)  
  Install via pip:
  ```bash
  pip install streamlit
